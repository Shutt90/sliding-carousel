# Sliding-Carousel

Can be downloaded using npm install sliding-carousel
Use the container element class i.e ".container" as the first arguement, the second should be the leftarrow class/id such as ".leftarrow" or "#leftarrow" and the next arguement should be for the right arrow such as ".rightarrow" or "#rightarrow".

Ideal div layers would be:

outer div, 
arrow left,
arrow right,
carousel div,
images * however many,
close carousel div,
close outer div,
