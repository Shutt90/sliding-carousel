# Sliding-Carousel

Can be downloaded using npm i sliding-carousel
Use the container element class i.e ".container" as the first arguement, the second should be the leftarrow class/id such as ".leftarrow" or "#leftarrow" and the next arguement should be for the right arrow such as ".rightarrow" or "#rightarrow".

# Ideal div layers would be:

Outer div, <br/>
Arrow left, <br/>
Arrow right, <br/>
Carousel div, <br/>
Images * however many, <br/>
Close carousel div, <br/>
Close outer div, <br/>
<br/>

Obviously style how you wish from there
